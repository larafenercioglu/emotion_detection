# emotion_detection
CS464 Introduction to Machine Learning Term Project @ Bilkent University

The main purpose of this project is to detect which emotion is present in a given speech.
We have converted the speeches to MFCC to take advantage of its ability to demonstrate 
the short-term power spectrum of a sound and take the coefficients as features. Then we 
use SVM, CNN, and RNN algorithms to classify different emotions. 
Classes we want to classify are {0: sad, 1: angry, 2: happy, 3: disgust, 4: neutral, 5: fear}.
